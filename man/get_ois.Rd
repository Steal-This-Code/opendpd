\usage{
get_ois(
  start_date = NULL,
  end_date = NULL,
  outcome = NULL,
  suspect_weapon = NULL,
  disposition = NULL,
  limit = 1000,
  select = NULL,
  where = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Optional. A character string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format or a
Date object specifying the minimum incident date (inclusive, based on `date` field).}

\item{end_date}{Optional. A character string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format or a
Date object specifying the maximum incident date (inclusive, based on `date` field).}

\item{outcome}{Optional. A character vector of outcomes to filter by
(e.g., 'DECEASED', 'INJURED', 'SHOOT AND MISS'), matching the
`suspect_deceased_injured_or_shoot_and_miss` field.}

\item{suspect_weapon}{Optional. A character vector of suspect weapon types
to filter by (e.g., 'HANDGUN', 'RIFLE', 'KNIFE'), matching the `suspect_weapon` field.}

\item{disposition}{Optional. A character vector of Grand Jury dispositions
to filter by (e.g., 'NO BILL', 'TRUE BILL'), matching the `grand_jury_disposition` field.}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of records to return. Defaults to 1000.
Use `limit = Inf` to attempt retrieving all matching records.}

\item{select}{A character vector specifying which columns to retrieve.
If NULL (default), all available columns are retrieved.}

\item{where}{An optional character string containing a custom SoQL WHERE clause
(e.g., `"case = '012345-2023'"`). Overrides other filter arguments if provided.}

\item{...}{Additional SODA query parameters passed directly to the API URL,
(e.g., `$order = "date DESC"`).}
}
\value{
A `tibble` containing the requested OIS data.
}
\description{
This function queries the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) for Dallas Police
Officer Involved Shootings. It allows filtering by date range, outcome,
suspect weapon, and grand jury disposition. It supports retrieving
large datasets through automatic pagination. Note that detailed geographic
filters (zip, beat, etc.) and geographic object conversion are not available
for this specific dataset via this function.

If the `where` argument is provided, it overrides all other filter arguments.
}
\details{
Retrieves OIS data from the Dallas Open Data portal API
(SODA endpoint 4gmt-jyx2).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get 10 most recent OIS incidents
recent_ois <- get_ois(limit = 10, `$order` = "date DESC")
print(recent_ois)

# Get OIS incidents from 2023 where outcome was 'DECEASED' (replace with valid year)
# deceased_ois <- get_ois(
#   start_date = "2023-01-01", end_date = "2023-12-31",
#   outcome = "DECEASED"
# )
# print(deceased_ois)

# Get OIS incidents where suspect weapon was reported as 'HANDGUN' or 'RIFLE'
firearm_ois <- get_ois(suspect_weapon = c("HANDGUN", "RIFLE"), limit = 50)
print(firearm_ois)

# Use 'where' clause for case number lookup
# specific_case <- get_ois(where = "case = '012345-2023'") # Use actual case number
# print(specific_case)
